The Evolutionary Action (EA) is an untrained method that measures the fitness effect of coding mutations analytically from protein evolution data (Katsonis and Lichtarge, 2014). Here, EA used 87 and 69 homologous sequences of the PTEN (NP_000305) and the TPMT (NP_000358) human proteins, respectively. Those sequences were selected to represent adequate evolutionary depth out of the hundreds of homologous sequences found by standard protein BLAST (Altschul, et al., 1997). The EA scores predict the fitness change for each mutation that displaces the sequence from the wildtype position in the fitness landscape on a relative scale from 0 to 100. Although these scores are estimates of the probability of each variant to affect protein activity, for the purposes of this challenge they were treated as estimates of protein stability. Therefore, the stability was predicted to be: 1-EA/100 (to match the experimental value range of 0 (unstable) to 1 (wt stability). Silent variant were assumed to be stable (predicted to be: 1). Nonsense variants were annotated either as stable (predicted to be: 1) or as unstable (predicted to be: 0) based on whether they occured on the folded domains of pdb structures, respectively (PDB: 1d5r for PTEN; PDB: 2bzg for TPMT). EA is available for non-profit use at http://mammoth.bcm.tmc.edu/EvolutionaryAction.
