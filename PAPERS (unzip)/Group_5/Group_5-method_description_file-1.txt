The Evolutionary Action (EA) is an untrained method that measures the fitness effect of coding mutations analytically from protein evolution data (Katsonis and Lichtarge, 2014). Here, EA used 87 and 69 homologous sequences of the PTEN (NP_000305) and the TPMT (NP_000358) human proteins, respectively. Those sequences were selected to represent adequate evolutionary depth out of the hundreds of homologous sequences found by standard protein BLAST (Altschul, et al., 1997). The EA scores predict the fitness change for each mutation that displaces the sequence from the wildtype position in the fitness landscape on a relative scale from 0 to 100. These scores are estimates of the probability of each variant to affect protein activity, which is different from the variant impact on protein stability. In order to bridge this difference, we devalued the evolutionary importance of the surface residues according to their solvent accesibility. Therefore, the stability was predicted to be: 1-EI/100 (to match the experimental value range of 0 (unstable) to 1 (wt stability), where MI represents the Evolutionary Action for buried protein residues and a reduced Evolutionary Action for solvent exposed residues (reduction was proportional to the solvent accesibility). Silent variant were assumed to be stable (predicted to be: 1). Nonsense variants were annotated either as stable (predicted to be: 1) or as unstable (predicted to be: 0) based on whether they occured on the folded domains of pdb structures, respectively (PDB: 1d5r for PTEN; PDB: 2bzg for TPMT).
